# Smart House Management System
This is a Java console project simulating a smart home. It includes features such as lights, a thermostat, and a security system, and allows the user to manage and monitor their states.

***This project was based on the assignment script in the interface section of "Uygulamalarla Nesne YÃ¶nelimli Programlama" course at BTK Academy.***

I would like to sincerely thank (https://github.com/zcomert) for their inspiring teaching.
